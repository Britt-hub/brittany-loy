## Brittany's Portfolio

[Check out my portfolio](https://brittany-loy.herokuapp.com/).

This is my most recent portfolio where you can see my projects and learn more about me. This page displays links to github, linkedin and my resume as well as serves as a functional display of my capabilities. At the bottom on the page you can see my links to my social media accounts. The purpose of this project is to give a functional look at my front end abilities and to display previous projects to potential employers.
